# question_for_you_quiz

# timed-questionnaire

## This homework objective was to create a timed quiz. When the user presses start the timer will begin and the first question will appear on the screen.

## Each question had four possible answer choices shown as buttons with event listeners attached in the js file so keep note of if an question was answered correctly.

## The timer is also an important part of this assignment because that is how the score is kept. The user has a total of 60 seconds to answer the questions, and the time left over after you finish the quiz is your final score. If you answer a question incorrectly, you will lose 15 seconds from the timer and worsen your score.

## I ran out of time with the styling and also didn't have time to finish the final score/game over page with the username, but will go back later and try to figure that out.

# Enjoy!
